# Bitcoin Tracker - Next.js Project

This is a **Bitcoin Tracker** web application built with **Next.js** that tracks the current Bitcoin price using a **Tracker API**. The application provides real-time updates and allows users to see the current price and historical data for Bitcoin.

## Features

- Real-time Bitcoin price tracking.
- Fetches data from a **Tracker API**.
- Clean and responsive user interface.
- Displays the current Bitcoin price in USD (or other currencies as needed).
- Displays historical price data in a graphical format (if API supports).
- Lightweight and fast due to Next.js SSR (Server-Side Rendering) capabilities.

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin-tracker.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd bitcoin-tracker
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file to store environment variables. For example:

    ```env
    API_URL=your-api-url
    API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

5. Run the application locally:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Upon starting the application, the current Bitcoin price will be displayed.
- Historical price data is available through a graph (if the API supports such data).
- You can update the application to support additional currencies by modifying the API endpoints and adjusting the UI to display the selected currency.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** - Framework for server-side rendering and building React apps.
- **React** - JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tracker API** - API to fetch Bitcoin price data (custom or third-party API).
- **CSS (or Tailwind CSS)** - For styling the app.
- **Vercel** (optional) - For easy deployment to the web.
